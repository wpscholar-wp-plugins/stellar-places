## Description
**Stellar Places** is an intuitive plugin for easily creating, managing and displaying locations using Google Maps.

There are plenty of Google Maps plugins for WordPress, but very few actually use custom post types to manage locations. Additionally most don't have a simple and intuitive interface.  Let's take a look at some use cases where Stellar Places shines:

- **Store Locator** - If you own a business that has multiple physical locations, this plugin will automatically feature a list of all store locations as well as provide a page for each store location, which is good for local SEO.

- **Local Events** - If your organization sponsors or holds local events, this plugin makes it easy to display them all on a map, or even display subsets based on categories.

Let us how know how you are using Stellar Places!
