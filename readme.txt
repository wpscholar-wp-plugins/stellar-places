Easily create, manage and display locations in a way that makes sense.

== Description ==

**Stellar Places** is an intuitive plugin for easily creating, managing and displaying locations using Google Maps.

= How? =

Using this plugin is simple:

1. Install the plugin
2. Activate the plugin
3. In the WordPress admin, click on 'Places'
4. Click on 'Add New' and create a new place.

Once you have added a new place, you will be able to access the listing view and single location view, both of which will automatically have maps associated with them.  If you wish to insert a map in a custom location, just use the `[stellar_places_map]` shortcode (see FAQ section for more details).

= Why? =

There are plenty of Google Maps plugins for WordPress, but very few actually use custom post types to manage locations. Additionally most don't have a simple and intuitive interface.  Let's take a look at some use cases where Stellar Places shines:

- **Store Locator** - If you own a business that has multiple physical locations, this plugin will automatically feature a list of all store locations as well as provide a page for each store location, which is good for local SEO.

- **Local Events** - If your organization sponsors or holds local events, this plugin makes it easy to display them all on a map, or even display subsets based on categories.

Let us how know how you are using Stellar Places!

= Features =

* Live map preview
* Drag and drop marker relocation
* Location pages for better SEO
* Unlimited locations and maps
* Mobile friendly, responsive maps
* Easy map embeds via shortcode
* Clean, well written code that won't bog down your site

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I insert a map? =
Just use the `[stellar_places_map]` shortcode in your post content, or even in a text widget.

= What options are available with the [stellar_places_map] shortcode? =

*HTML Attributes*

- **id** - The HTML id attribute for the wrapping div.
- **class**  - The HTML class attribute for the wrapping div.
- **width** - Sets the width of the map.  Can be defined in any standard CSS measurement (e.g. 100%, 600px). Defaults to '100%'.
- **height** - Sets the height of the map.  Should be defined in pixels (i.e. 600px). Defaults to '400px'.

*Query Parameters*

- **post_type** - Limit items displayed to a specific post type.  Only supported post types can be displayed.
- **taxonomy** - Sets the taxonomy to be used in conjunction with the 'term' attribute. Defaults to 'stlr_location_categories'.
- **term** - Limit items displayed to a specific taxonomy term.  Requires the 'taxonomy' attribute to be set.  A term slug should be provided.
- **category** - An alias for 'term'.
- **post_id** - Limit items displayed to a specific post.  This will effectively display a single marker for a specific location on the map.

*Map Settings*

- **lat** - The default latitude for the map center, when no markers are displayed.
- **lng** - The default longitude for the map center, when no markers are displayed.
- **mapTypeId** - Sets the map type for the Google Map. Options are:
    - **roadmap** - Displays the default road map view. This is the default map type.
    - **satellite** - Displays Google Earth satellite images.
    - **hybrid** - Displays a mixture of normal and satellite views.
    - **terrain** - Displays a physical map based on terrain information.
- **scrollwheel** - Defaults to 'false', which prevents the map from zooming when scrolled over.
- **zoom** - The default zoom for the map, when no markers are displayed. *Required if no markers are being displayed.*  Zoom levels are integers between 1 and 20.
- **minzoom** - The minimum zoom level which will be displayed on the map. Zoom levels are integers between 1 and 20.
- **maxzoom** - The maximum zoom level which will be displayed on the map. Zoom levels are integers between 1 and 20.
- **infowindows** - Defaults to 'true', which enables the display of popups when clicking on map markers.

Example usage of the shortcode options:

`[stellar_places_map post_id="29" maxzoom="14" height="250px" width="250px" mapTypeId="hybrid"]`

= How can I customize the content that appears on the single location pages and on the post type archive page? =

The Stellar Places plugin uses templates to control what appears in these areas.  By default, the templates used are found in the `/includes/templates` directory of the plugin.  However, in your theme you can create a `/stellar-places` directory and, if present, the plugin will load templates from there instead.  If you wish to customize the templates found in the plugin, just copy the files over to your theme and then start editing!

= Can I customize the content in the popups that appear when clicking on map markers? =

Absolutely.  There is an `/includes/templates` directory in the plugin that contains a file called `info-window.html`. This file contains all of the code used to render the content of the popups.  You can create a `/stellar-places` directory in your theme and copy over the `info-window.html` file and edit it to fit your needs. The file uses the Underscore.js template engine and is a client-side template.
